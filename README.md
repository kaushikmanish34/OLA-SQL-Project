## OLA Ride Sales Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing OLA ride booking data using SQL.
The objective was to solve real-world business queries such as customer behavior, booking trends, cancellations, payments, and ratings.
By writing SQL queries and creating views, I extracted insights that can help ride-hailing businesses understand performance, improve services, and optimize revenue.

## üõ† Tech Stack

Database: MySQL

Language: SQL

## Concepts Used: Views, Group By, Order By, Aggregations, Filtering, Joins

üìä Problem Statements Solved

1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve all successful bookings

Created a view to fetch all bookings where booking_status = 'success'.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type

Grouped rides by vehicle type and calculated the average distance.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Get the total number of canceled rides by customers

Counted all rides where booking_status = 'canceled'.

4Ô∏è‚É£ List the Top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides

Grouped by customer_id, ordered by ride count, and limited to Top 5.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Get the number of rides canceled by drivers due to personal reasons

Filtered rides with cancellation reason = "personal".

6Ô∏è‚É£ Find maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings

Selected MAX and MIN ratings where vehicle_type = 'Prime Sedan'.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI

Created a view for bookings where payment_method = 'UPI'.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Find the average customer rating per vehicle type

Grouped by vehicle type and calculated AVG(customer_rating).
